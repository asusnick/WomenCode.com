## Git Workflow

_I want to.._

* **Make Changes**
1. Make sure you're in the master branch by typing the following in the command line: ```git checkout master```
2. "Pull" the current version of master: ```git pull```
3. Create a branch for your changes: ```git branch "your-branch-name"```
4. Go into your newly created branch: ```git checkout your-branch-name```
5. Make your changes!

* **Submit My Changes**
1. Check the status of your files: ```git status```
(all of your changed files should be red)
2. Add your changed files to the "staging area": ```git add -A```
3. Check the status of your files (again!): ```git status```
(all of your changed files should be green)
4. Create a message briefly describing your commit: ```git commit -m "adds this update to feature x"```
5. "Push" your files to GitHub: ```git push origin head```
